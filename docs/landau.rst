Landau Damping
---------------

One of the most fundamental plasma physics phenomenon is that described by Landau damping.

Plasmas can support electrostatic oscillations. The oscillation frequency is given by the electrostatic electron
plasma wave (EPW) dispersion relation. When a wave of sufficiently small amplitude is driven at the resonant
wave-number and frequency pairing, there is a resonant exchange of energy between the plasma and the electric field,
and the electrons can damp the electric field.

In VlaPy, we verify that the damping rate is reproduced for a few different wave numbers.
This is shown in `notebooks/landau_damping.ipynb.`

We include validation against this phenomenon as an integrated test.
